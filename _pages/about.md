Research Interests
---
My research interests are the theory and methods of optimization in the fields of sparse optimization, bilevel
optimization and Euclidean distance matrix optimization. 

* $Sparse~ optimization.$ Two efficient first order methods [MIRL1](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/MIRL1) and IIHT, and a powerful second order method [NHTP](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/NHTP) have been proposed to solve the sparsity constrained optimization. 

* $Bilevel~ optimization.$ A Matlab-based toolbox [BiOpt](https://biopt.github.io/) comprising a wide range collection of academic and real-world bilevel optimisation examples [BOLIB](https://biopt.github.io/bolib/), three power solvers and
several useful tools has beed created. 

* $Euclidean~ distance~ matrix~ optimization.$ This is the topic of my [PhD thesis](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/429739/), where majorization techniques were adopted to design fast algorithms equipped with two powerful solvers [PREEEDM](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/PREEEDM) and [SQREDM](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/SQREDM).
